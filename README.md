Extract the files into a new folder and then boot up the exe. It will ask you if you want to trust the code you can just press 'see more' and then press run anyway. It's just because i havent made a certificate.


For apple(((M1!!!!!!))), 
[click this](https://github.com/SourestOfLemons/Gamble/blob/main/build/Apple/Button%20(1)?raw=true), open the command prompt with command-space, paste 'chmod +x' and then drag the file in. you will then have a runnable app. I think.
